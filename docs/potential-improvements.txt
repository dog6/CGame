1. Clarity Improvements
Entity Class:

Instead of <vector<Entity> entities>, consider <const vector<Entity>& entities> in handleCollision() to avoid unnecessary copying.

Specify whether EntityType is an enum or class to clarify its usage.

IShape Interface:

You could include a setColor(Color color) method for flexibility in changing shape colors at runtime.

Tile and Tilemap:

Itâ€™s not clear why Tile has a size and position property, as Tilemap also tracks that. Maybe these should be handled solely by the Tilemap.

2. Functionality Suggestions
Scene Class:

It may benefit from a removeEntity(Entity* entity) method, especially for cases like object destruction or despawning.

Entity Class:

You could add a lifecycle event like onDestroy() for cleanup or logging.

Physics and Rigidbody:

A resetForce() method could be useful to clear applied forces between updates.

Consider adding rotational physics (angularVelocity, angularAcceleration, etc.) if you want more detailed simulations.

3. Code Structure Suggestions
Smallmath Class:

Consider renaming Smallmath to something like MathUtils to make it clearer what it does.

Tilemap Class:

You could add a loadFromFile(string path) function to import tile data from external files, useful for level design.

4. Potential Project Enhancements
Collision System:

A more efficient spatial partitioning system like a quadtree could optimize collision detection for larger scenes.

Game State Management:

You might want a StateManager to handle different game states (e.g., Menu, Gameplay, Pause) to keep the Game class cleaner.

Event System:

Implementing an event system with listeners for input events, collisions, or game state changes would enhance flexibility.
