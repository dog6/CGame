## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
  This is a small project I started to increase my comfort with C++ software development. The goal of this project is to create an enviroment
  that makes it easier to start developing. While there already exists plenty of open-source low-friction game engines, the scope of this engine
  will be much smaller, focusing ONLY on 2D games for the foreseeable future.

  The project can be compiled by cloning this repository and either running the batch file to execute a G++ command, or with CMake

  Please note this project is very early in development
